I am a Ph.D Candidate in Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. I hold Master's Degrees in Sociology from UC Berkeley and Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences from Columbia University. I research the intersection of work, culture, and inequality using quantitative and qualitative methods, as well as computational text analysis. My dissertation focuses on the criteria workers use to evaluate their job quality, and how these criteria are dependent on working conditions, inequality and social movements. The dissertation makes use of a broad range of data sets, including Glassdoor.com, Google Trends, The Shift Project, and my own survey experiments. Topic of my dissertation include the relationship between frontline workers and their customers, inequality in wages and schedule characteristics within the firm, and the impact of social movements on job quality evaluation criteria.

My primary specialties are in work, culture, and computational methods. I have additional research interests in economic sociology, organizations, stratification, and social networks. In my research, I have employed a variety of techniques, including computational and qualitative text analysis, machine learning, web scraping, geolocation and geographic regression, regression decomposition, and causal analyses such as difference-in-differences, and survey experimentation. My work has appeared in *The American Journal of Sociology*, *American Sociological Review*, and *Socio-Economic Review*. My research has been featured in *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, *Bloomberg*, and *CNN*.
