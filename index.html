<p>I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the [STORM Research Center in Strategy and Organizations at Emlyon Business School](https://www.storm.em-lyon.com). I was awarded my Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of California, Berkeley in August, 2022. I hold Master's Degrees in Sociology and Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences from UC Berkeley and Columbia University respectively. I research how macro-level processes, such as social movement activism, low-road labor practices, and quantification, impact inequality, discrimination, and meaning-making at work, using a mix of quantitative methods, computational text analysis, and qualitative text analysis. My dissertation focuses on uncovering overlooked dimensions of how frontline foodservice and retail workers evaluate their job quality, with a focus on the role of relationships in shaping how worker's make sense of the workplace. The dissertation makes use of a broad range of data sets, including <a href="www.glassdoor.com">Glassdoor</a>, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US">Google Trends</a>, <a href="https://shift.hks.harvard.edu">The Shift Project</a>, and an original survey experiment. Specific topics explore how job satisfaction, as well as other outcomes, are associated with differences in how frontline workers discuss their customers, inequality in wages and schedule characteristics within the firm, and the impact of COVID-19 on workplace relationships.</p>

<p>As a Post-Doctoral researcher, I have developed a focus on understanding how organizational decision-making impacts experiences of discrimination in the workplace. These projects draw on employer-identified survey data in order to understand how organizational decisions a) expose workers to incivility and discrimination, and b) shape perceptions around acceptable solutions to workplace discrimination. In my research, I have employed a variety of techniques, including computational and qualitative text analysis, machine learning, web scraping, geolocation and spatial analysis, regression decomposition, and causal analyses such as difference-in-differences, and survey experimentation. My work has appeared in <em>The American Journal of Sociology</em>, <em>American Sociological Review</em>, <em>Socio-Economic Review</em>, and <em>Work and Occupations</em>. My research has been featured in <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Politico</em>, <em>Bloomberg</em>, <em>CNN</em>, and the <em>Stanford Social Innovation Review</em>.
